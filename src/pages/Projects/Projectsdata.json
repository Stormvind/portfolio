			"description":"This is an application that my mob and I made for a 9 day jam when we were training at </salt>, from idea to planning to execution. Its concept is to help people with the same interests meet up and practice them in person. We got the idea after a mob member wanted to play basketball during a weekend, but couldn't find anywhere or any one to play. It is made with the SERN stack: SQL, Express, React, and Node. Sessions are handled with the Express session library. The passwords of users are hashed using Argon2.",
